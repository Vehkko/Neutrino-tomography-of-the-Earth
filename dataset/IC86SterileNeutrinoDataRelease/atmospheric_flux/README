/atmospheric_flux:
=================

This folder contains the atmospheric flux calculations used in the analysis. The 
fluxes given in this file have been propagated through the Earth. For the record
we also provide the initial unpropagated fluxes.

/differential:
=============
The first format is a simple table where the flux with the following structure:

# cos(th) NeutrinoEnergy nu_pion nubar_pion nu_kaon nubar_kaon

where cos(th) is the cosine of the zenith angle, the NeutrinoEnergy is the energy 
of the neutrino given in GeV, and the muon neutrino fluxes for the pion and kaon 
components are given in GeV^-1 cm^-2 s^-1 sr^-1.

/averaged:
==========
The second format is the bin-averaged neutrino flux, in which we have
averaged over true energy bins, cos(th) bins, and azimuth. This is given in 
order to more readily convolute with the detector response array.

The flux tensor has the following indices:

Phi_{cth,nu_e},

where cth is the cosine of the zenith angle and nu_e is the neutrino energy bin index.

The fluxes are given in HDF5 format and have the following data sets:

average_flux_nu_kaon     Dataset {21, 200}
average_flux_nu_pion     Dataset {21, 200}
average_flux_nubar_kaon  Dataset {21, 200}
average_flux_nubar_pion  Dataset {21, 200}
costh_reco_bin_edges     Dataset {22}
e_true_bin_edges         Dataset {201}

where the numbers in braces are the sizes along each dimension of the set. The units
of the neutrino energy bin edges are given in GeV and the averaged fluxes are given
in GeV^-1 sr^-1 cm^-2 s^-1.
