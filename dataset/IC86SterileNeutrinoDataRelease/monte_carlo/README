============

Contains the MC events reconstructed using the nominal detector configuration.
The MC event properties listed are:

# PDGID ReconstructedMuonEnergy cos(th_reco) NeutrinoEnergy cos(th_true) mcweight neutrino_from_pion_flux neutrino_from_kaon_flux,

where PDGID is the Particle Data Group identifier of incident neutrino, cos(th_true) is cosine of the true direction, cos(th_reco) is the cosine of the reconstructed direction, NeutrinoEnergy is the energy of the neutrino in GeV, ReconstructedMuonEnergy is the reconstructed muon energy in GeV, and
mcweight is event MC weight given in units of GeV cm^2 s sr. For convenience, we have also provided the pion and kaon neutrino flux for the Honda+Gaisser model.

In order to obtain event distributions using this MC, you have to fold
it in with the neutrino flux at the IceCube Detector. This flux should be given in units of 1/(GeV cm^2 s sr). The event weight is then given by

weight = mcweight * neutrino_flux,

where the neutrino_flux has to be evaluated in the true neutrino quantities.

If one wishes to use the provided nominal Honda+Gaisser model, then:

weight = mcweight * (neutrino_from_pion_flux + neutrino_from_kaon_flux)
